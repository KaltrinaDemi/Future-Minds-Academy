        <h1>Economic System</h1>
        <p>Certainly! Economic systems are the structures and mechanisms that societies use to produce, distribute, and
            consume goods and services. There are several types of economic systems, each with its own characteristics
            and
            principles. Here are a few key concepts related to economics</p>

        <h1>Mixed Economy</h1>
        <p>Inflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, resulting
            in
            a decrease in purchasing power. Moderate inflation is considered normal in most economies, but high or
            hyperinflation can be detrimental.

            Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is actively seeking
            employment but unable to find jobs. It is a crucial indicator of economic health and is often monitored by
            policymakers.

            Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy involves government decisions regarding taxation and spending to influence the
            economy. Governments use fiscal policy to stabilize economic fluctuations and promote growth.

            Monetary Policy: Monetary policy is controlled by a country's central bank and involves managing the money
            supply, interest rates, and credit conditions to achieve economic goals such as price stability and full
            employment.

            Trade and Globalization: International trade plays a significant role in modern economies, allowing
            countries to
            specialize in the production of goods and services where they have a comparative advantage. Globalization
            has
            increased the interconnectedness of economies worldwide.</p>
